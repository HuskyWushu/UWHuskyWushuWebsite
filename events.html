               Collegiate Wushu Tournament
            </p>
             <p>
            The Annual Collegiate Wushu Tournament was created to foster collegiate-level wushu in the nation.
            The first tournament was hosted by the University of Oregon in 1997, organized by Brandon Sugiyama.
            Today, the tournament draws in competitors from colleges all across the country. Last year's tournament
            (2013) had competitors from 21 different colleges and 13 groups in the team competition demonstrating
            that the tournament has been drawing more and more midwest and eastern schools in recent years.

                Lunar New Year
            </p>
            <p>
            Chinese New Year is an important traditional Chinese holiday celebrated at the turn of the Chinese calendar
            In China, it is also known as the Spring Festival, the literal translation of the modern Chinese name.
            Chinese New Year celebrations traditionally run from Chinese New Year's Eve, the last day of the last month
            of the Chinese calendar, to the Lantern Festival on the 15th day of the first month, making the festival the
            longest in the Chinese calendar. Because the Chinese calendar is lunisolar, the Chinese New Year is often
            referred to as the "Lunar New Year".
