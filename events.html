                The Chinese Lunar New Year is a very important holiday in Chinese culture -- It is a time to celebrate
                many different values including good fortune, happiness, wealth, and longevity. Most importantly, it is
                a time where family comes together.

                Every year, Chinese Student Association proudly hosts this event free of charge for UW students and the
                Husky Wushu performs in this important holiday

                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
                leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
                release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
                like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                Each year, a call is made to clubs for the position of host and bids are voted on by the Collegiate Wushu Committee
                voting members. The CWC is composed of advisors and school representatives, with each school on the CWC posessing one
                voting representative. The CWC also discusses and votes on changes to tournament rules such as competitor eligiblity
                requirements and experience level determination. To receive an invitation to the CWC, a school must have hosted at least
                one Collegiate Wushu Tournament.
