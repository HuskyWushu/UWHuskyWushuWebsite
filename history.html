        <h1>Origins</h1>

        <p>Wushu (simplified Chinese: 武术; traditional Chinese: 武術) is both an exhibition and a full-contact sport
            derived
            from traditional Chinese martial arts. It was developed in China after 1949, in an effort to standardize the
            practice of traditional Chinese martial arts, although attempts to structure the various decentralized
            martial
            arts traditions date back earlier, when the Central Guoshu Institute was established at Nanking in 1928. The
            term
            wushu is Chinese for "martial arts" (武 "Wu" = military or martial, 术 "Shu" = art). In contemporary times,
            wushu
            has become an international sport through the International Wushu Federation (IWUF), which holds the World
            Wushu
            Championships every two years; the first World Championships were held in 1991 in Beijing and won by Yuan
            Wen Qing.

        <h1>Our background - UW and seattle wushu</h1>

        <p>the husky wushu team was created because the UW needed a group to represent wushu among the other more
            visible martial arts groups.
            the seattle wushu scene is small and fragmented, and people have few options for places to learn wushu
            and connect with other wushu players.
            by having an official collegiate club, we're better able to create an environment for the transmission
            of wushu knowledge allowing people
            with similar interests to connect and guide the development of wushu in seattle.

        <h1>Accolades</h1>

        <p>wushu practice at the UW has largely been an underground thing, only known about by a few dedicated
            practitioners. the yue fei wushu club was the earliest known group to practice wushu at UW. the members
            were
            experienced and learned wushu from prominent local teachers like hong yijao, former zhejiang wushu team
            member;
            mark jackson, former british national team member; and michael li.
            at their height in 2004, they had as many as 20 members practicing at the IMA. but they never became
            official,
            and major obstacles caused the group to eventually dissipate to just a few dedicated athletes.</p>

        <p>the next UW wushu group was another unofficial fledgling group that represented the small wushu
            population in
            seattle. weekly practices rarely had more than 3 people, but this routine set the stage for the creation
            of the
            current wushu club
            as the group gained more interested practitioners and participated at several large performances and
            competed at
            tournaments.
        </p>

        <p>we are now a larger group that practices regularly at the IMA.
            we also regularly perform for UW student organizations and also many
            other non-UW organizations within seattle. we also compete at the
            annual collegiates competition against other universities, along with the
            annual CMAT competition at UC Berkeley, the largest chinese
            martial arts competition in the the United States.

    <h1>Hopes and Dreams</h1>

    <p>

    <p>we made our debut at the 16th Annual Chinese Martial Arts Tournament hosted by UC Berkeley. freshman
        priscilla
        dang won 3rd place in the women's advanced longfist division and 1st in advanced other weapon. junior
        and team
        captain travis dang won 1st place in the men's advanced longfist division. we'll be back next year for
        more
        medals.

    </p>

    <p>not only do we practice wushu, we teach a children's wushu class at chinese school on saturdays. it's a
        chance
        for us to spread interest in wushu even farther, inspire the next generation of wushu athletes, and give
        back to
        the community.
    </p>

    <p>in the future, we hope to become a club sport at UW, offer formal wushu classes coached by li tianyuan,
        and
        become a contributing part to the development of US wushu. currently, we're working on our fundamentals,
        the
        basic techniques and conditioning,
        getting our team organized for upcoming demos and performances, and having fun at the same time.
